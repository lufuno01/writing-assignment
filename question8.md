First and foremost I would like to create an app for the taxi industry that they are going to use to do their daily activities effectively and this app will resolve the conflict that has been going on for a while between the Uber drivers and the taxi drivers and this app will bring peace to the two parties.

My success is worth every breath that I take every second, I don't want a success that will be measured in terms of the materialistic things that I would have managed to accomplish, I want my success to be measured by how many people I have managed to move their hearts and souls in a positive way this is the reason why my success is worth every breath that I take in every second.

My weakness is, that I am too judgemental I spend most of the time focusing on every single detail in vividly way since I am a detailed oriented-person, which sometimes it slows me down when I am trying to get things accomplished within a short period. This weakness of mine is born out of the simplicity of wanting to do be a perfectionist when it comes to doing my job because I want everything to be perfect, but I am learning to get things done on time without exceeding the given time frame whilst still maintaining a high standard. 

Another Weakness that I possess which I believe will stand in my way of success which is I find it very hard for me to say no to other people due to the reason that I don't want to hurt their feelings since I know how it feels this is caused by the fact that I don't want to show them that I can't do it because I want to meet their expectations. This is the problem of mine because I always say yes to everything even though I do not have the extra capacity to do so, in the past, I ended up becoming overwhelmed by taking on too many responsibilities, but now before I say yes I now take my time to assess my workload before I say I do to make sure I have the extra capacity to commit to the extra workload. I find it very hard to ask other people for help when I need it because I take great pride in everything that I do and when I encounter problems I always try to figure the way out by myself however I do comprehend it would be more helpful to seek help from others who are more exposed than myself. I can be very sensitive sometimes, my sensitivity can be considered a positive attribute variously, it means I genuinely care about the people who are in my life and I find it very hard to take criticism but I do comprehend that in order for me to grow in life I need to criticism has productive and constructive for me to be able to continue and grow.

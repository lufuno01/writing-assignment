In my free time, I relish interacting with my peers who are on the same level of hierarchy as me in terms of mindset, reasoning capacity, and goal-oriented because I found it very easy to initiate a confabulation that everyone can indulge in even if it is a general confabulation I also love to spend some quality time with kids because from my experience I consume a lot of knowledge from kids tand hey show me a way of doing things when it comes to some aspects. I also love teaching kids how they should utilize some of the platforms to help them  enhance their skills especially when it comes to doing something that their zealous about and lastly I also love to show them how some of these platforms were implemented and which tools were used to implement these existing platforms

 I relish going for a jog in the evening or a walk in the afternoon as a data engineering student I devote most of my days in front of my computer which is not the healthiest thing that is why I try to reduce the time I devote on my laptop when I am outside of the Bootcamp I try to give my back and my eyes the rest that they deserve you can say I relish being outside and moving when I am not busy with my boot camp activities.

 I love doing research  and reading books on programming, philosophy, and political novels  I also enjoy reading them but they also help me to enhance  and broaden my horizons and to learn a lot of things that I can utilize in my school work other than that they help me to improve my vocabulary and my communication skills and they also play a vital role in making my mind relax a bit most of all their also help me to learn some new things and they enlighten me ina broad way.

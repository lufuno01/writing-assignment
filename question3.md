In my free time, I relish interacting with my peers who are on the same level of hierarchy as me in terms of mindset, reasoning capacity, and goal-oriented because I found it very easy to initiate a confabulation that everyone can indulge in even if it is a general confabulation I also love to spend some quality time with kids because from my experience I consume a lot of knowledge from kids and hey show me a way of doing things when it comes to some aspects. I also love teaching kids how they should utilize some of the platforms to help them  enhance their skills especially when it comes to doing something that their zealous about lastly I also love to show them how some of these platforms were implemented and which tools were used to implement these existing platforms

 I relish going for a jog in the evening or a walk in the afternoon as a data engineering student I devote most of my days in front of my computer which is not the healthiest thing that is why I try to reduce the time I devote to my laptop when I am outside of the Bootcamp I try to give my back and my eyes the rest that they deserve you can say I relish being outside and moving when I am not busy with my boot camp activities.

 I love doing research and reading books on programming, philosophy, and political novels  I also enjoy reading them but they also help me to enhance and broaden my horizons and to learn a lot of things that I can utilize in my school work other than that they help me to improve my vocabulary and my communication skills and they also play a vital role in making my mind relax a bit most of all their also help me to learn some new things and they broadly enlighten me.

There is no other way that I won't make it the only thing that I know is that I have to make it that is the only option I have, there's no other option this is the only thing I want I will do whatever it takes to make it work and I am willing to protect my dreams by any means necessary there's nothing that will come between and my dreams.
If I do not make it as one of the best data engineers I will take my second option which is data analysis I do not see myself persuading anything outside the industry of technology I am zealous about anything that has to do with technology so I will consider my second option if it ever happens that I do not succeed in the data engineer field.

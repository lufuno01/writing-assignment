I learned how to code at the tertiary level I was taught how to code using c++, visual studio, and embarcadero. I am grateful for the chance and the wisdom that has been passed to me by my former lectures. They taught me a lot of things, their also passed me some fundamental advice that will lead me to a fruitful and successful career as a coder, even though the journey had some unforeseen difficulties. The relevant experience that I currently possessed regarding c++ and visual studio we used to use c++ for writing programs that will output the final results and embarcadero we were using it to write a code that will produce the required graphical user interface. This is the only module that showed me flames but I managed to show it flames at the end.

Last semester we were doing a final project which determines if you are ready to go out and join the industry or not. We were instructed that we should not use the languages that we were taught we should try other languages. So I learned how to develop a website using Html, CSS, Javascript, PHP, MYSQL DBMS, and PhpMyAdmin. And at the end, I and my team managed to create a successful website that was required as a final project. One thing I like about scripting language and programming is once you learn how to be efficient in one language the transition is not that difficult that is why I am not having that hard times when it comes to the syntax was not that hard on my side the only thing that I am currently having hard times with is adapting to the continually changing environment.
